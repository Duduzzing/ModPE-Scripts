#CorkSponge README

 * What is it?

CorkSponge is an "Simple compressor for who wants to compress string into human-readable file". It compresses string and the compressed string could be an summary for original data. Compressing binary would be supported, but no official support yet.

 * How to use?
 
Library usage example is in progress.

 * What does the 'summary' actually stores?
 
  * Frequently used data dictionary for compression
  * Compressed date/time
  * Compression manifest(e.g. MD5 hash, Sign(if exists), CorkSponge version used to compress)
  
 * How can I contribute?

Just fork/commit and make a pull request. I'll be very appreciative for that.
